# MATLAB-Arduino-ESP8266-IoT

A student project for ENGR114 at Portland Community College. Uses MATLAB connected to an Arudino over serial to control an ESP8266 over serial that can connect over WiFi to an IoT server.

## Problem Statement: 
Wirelessly upload light sensor data using an Arduino connected to an ESP8266 over serial.
 
### Assumptions: 
No admin access on college computers, students canâ€™t install drivers or new software. WiFi network requires student username and student G#.
 
## Summary:
1. Assemble Hardware
2. Wire together ESP8266, logic converter, Arudio and power supply
3. ESP8266 test
   * If needed:
      * ESP8266 set default baud rate 9600
      * Upload new firmware with esptool.py
4. Arduino - Upload Code, test photo cell
5. Arduino - ESP8266 soft serial test to PC
6. Arduino - Upload Code, test software serial to ESP8266
   consider changing soft serial baud rate to 4800 and ESP8266 baud rate to 4800 and increasing software serial cache size
   mySerial swSerial(4800,false,256)?
7. ThingSpeak - set up channel
8. Arduino - Upload code, push sensor readings to ThingSpeak
9.  PC - view sensor data on ThingSpeak

### ESP8266 Test

Plug in the USB cable from the Arduino to the computer. This will connect the ESP8266 (through the Arduino) to the computer. Open the Arduino Serial monitor (Tools --> Serial Monitor): 
* 9600 baud
* Both NL & CR.
* Ensure Tools --> Port is set correctly 'COM4' is common

![serial monitor](/doc/serial_monitor.PNG)

This allows the computer to directly communicate with the ESP8266. Switch on the breadboard power supply to power the ESP8266. 

### ESP8266 Test Commands

Try the following commands in the Serial Monitor:

```
AT
AT+RST
AT+GMR
AT+CWJAP?
AT+CWMODE?
AT+CWMODE=3
AT+CWMODE?      #[should be +CWMODE:3]
AT+CWJAP="Your SSID","Your WiFi Password"
AT+CWLAP
AT+CIPSTAMAC?
AT+CIFSR
AT+RST
AT
```

The Serial Monitor output of these commands should look like the output below:

```

If all of the above commands work, you do not need to set the default baud rate to 9600 or flash the firmware using esptool.py. If the above commands do not work, you may need to change the default baud rate and upload new firmware.


#### ESP8266 set default baud rate 9600

Follow these instructions to set the ESP8266 default baud rate to 9600:

[set ESP8266 baud rate](/doc/set_esp8266_baud_rate.md)
   

#### Use esptool.py to upload new firmware
This is a faily involved process and not for the faint of heart. If the AT command's don't work even after the default baud rate was set to 9600 baud, follow these instructions to upload new firmware to the ESP8266 using esptool.py

[Upload new firmware](/doc/upload_esp8266_firmware.md)

### Arduino - Upload Code, test photo cell

future link to Arduino Photocell Code

### Arduino - Upload Code, ESP8266 soft serial test to PC

future link to Arduino soft serial test to PC code

consider changing soft serial baud rate to 4800 and ESP8266 baud rate to 4800 and increasing software serial cache size ```mySerial swSerial(4800,false,256)?```

### Arduino - Upload Code, test software serial to ESP8266, hard serial to PC

If this does not work, use soft serial between PC and Arduino and hard serial between Arduino and ESP8266.
   
### ThingSpeak - set up channel

### Arduino - Upload code, push sensor readings to ThingSpeak

future link to Arduino code

###  PC - view sensor data on ThingSpeak
