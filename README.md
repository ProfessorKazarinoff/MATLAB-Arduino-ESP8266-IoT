### ESP8266 Test

Plug in the USB cable from the Arduino to the computer. This will connect the ESP8266 (through the Arduino) to the computer. Open the Arduino Serial monitor (Tools --> Serial Monitor): 
* 9600 baud
* Both NL & CR.
* Ensure Tools --> Port is set correctly 'COM4' is common

![serial monitor](/doc/serial_monitor.PNG)

This allows the computer to directly communicate with the ESP8266. Switch on the breadboard power supply to power the ESP8266. 

### ESP8266 Test Commands

Try the following commands in the Serial Monitor:

```
AT
AT+RST
AT+GMR
AT+CWJAP?
AT+CWMODE?
AT+CWMODE=3
AT+CWMODE?      #[should be +CWMODE:3]
AT+CWJAP="Your SSID","Your WiFi Password"
AT+CWLAP
AT+CIPSTAMAC?
AT+CIFSR
AT+RST
AT
```

The Serial Monitor output of these commands should look like the output below:

```

If all of the above commands work, you do not need to set the default baud rate to 9600 or flash the firmware using esptool.py. If the above commands do not work, you may need to change the default baud rate and upload new firmware.


#### ESP8266 set default baud rate 9600

Follow these instructions to set the ESP8266 default baud rate to 9600:

[set ESP8266 baud rate](/doc/set_esp8266_baud_rate.md)
   

#### Use esptool.py to upload new firmware
This is a faily involved process and not for the faint of heart. If the AT command's don't work even after the default baud rate was set to 9600 baud, follow these instructions to upload new firmware to the ESP8266 using esptool.py

[Upload new firmware](/doc/upload_esp8266_firmware.md)

## Use the ESP8266 to wirelessly flip a switch or measure a sensor

Once the ESP8266 has been tested and works properly, there are two choices for how to use it:

1. Upload programs directly to the ESP8266 (use Arduino as a serial cable)

2. Upload programs to the Arudino (use ESP8266 as a WiFi card)

It depends on the project and complexity which one of these options will be the best. 

If you only need one GPIO pin and that pin only needs to be set as High or Low or that one GPIO pin only needs to read High or Low, then uploading programs directly to the ESP8266 might make sense. This means all the functionality needs to be written into the program running on the ESP8266. You upload the program using the Arduino IDE and need to select the ESP8266 in the Tools--> Board menu. The Arduino will just act like serial cable to connect the ESP8266 to a computer. No code will run on the Arduino.

To run a program directly on the ESP8266, you can follow this tutorial: [Programming the ESP8266 with the Arduino IDE in 3 simple steps](https://ubidots.com/blog/esp8266-arduino-ide-tutorial/). Note the ESP8266 needs to be in bootloader mode when you upload the sketch (GPIO1 set to GND). When the ESP8266 runs your program, normal opperating mode, GPIO1 should not be set to ground. The only pin you can use to flip a switch or measure a High or Low signal is the GPIO2 pin (since you need the GPIO1 pin for bootloader mode).


If, you need more than one GPIO pin or the GPIO pin needs to read a varied voltage (not just High or Low) or write a varied voltage (not just High or Low), you will need to upload code the Arduino. This means all of the functionality needs to be written into the program running on the Arduino. The Arduino will commuicate over serial to the ESP8266 and tell it what ```AT``` commands to run. You upload the program using the Arduino IDE and need to select the Arduino Uno in the Tools --> Board menu. No code needs to be uploaded to the ESP8266 (as long as it is working properly)

To run code on the Arduino, follow the steps below:

### Arduino - Upload Code, test photo cell

Future link to Arduino Photocell Code


### Arduino - Upload Code, Arduino soft serial test to PC

Future link to Arduino soft serial test to PC code. Make sure soft serial works and that AT commands can be send between the Arduino and the PC over soft serial. These are the commands that the Arduino will send to the ESP8266. We just want to confirm that the commands are comming through by passing these commands to the PC instead of the ESP8266.

Consider changing soft serial baud rate to 4800 and ESP8266 baud rate to 4800 and increasing software serial cache size ```mySerial swSerial(4800,false,256)?```

### Arduino - Upload Code, test software serial to ESP8266, hard serial to PC

If this does not work, use soft serial between PC and Arduino and use hard serial between Arduino and ESP8266.
   
### ThingSpeak - set up channel

Set up a new channel on ThingSpeak.com. Make sure you have the channel number and channel API key

### Arduino - Upload code, push sensor readings to ThingSpeak

Future link to Arduino code. Arduino will measure sensor value and send value to ESP8266 over serial using AT commands.

###  PC - view sensor data on ThingSpeak

View the sensor data on ThingSpeak. Use MATLAB to download and analyze the data.
