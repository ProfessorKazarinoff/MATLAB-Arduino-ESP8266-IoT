# MATLAB-Arduino-ESP8266-IoT
A student project for ENGR114 at Portland Community College. Uses MATLAB connected to an Arudino over serial to control an ESP8266 over serial that can connect over WiFi to an IoT server 

## Problem Statement: 
Upload light sensor data wirelessly using an Arduino and ESP8266
 
### Assumptions: 
No admin access on PC, canâ€™t install drivers or software
 
## Summary:
- Assemble Hardware
- ESP8266 reflesh and test
- ESP8266 set default baud rate 9600
- Arduino - Upload Code, test photo cell
- Arduino - ESP8266 soft serial test to PC
- Arduino - Upload Code, test software serial to ESP8266
- ThingSpeak - set up channel
- Arduino - Upload code, push sensor readings to ThingSpeak
- PC - view sensor data on ThingSpeak
